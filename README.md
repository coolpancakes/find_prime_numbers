# find_prime_numbers
This algorithm is a python implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes which is a greek algorithm used for finding prime numbers. This algorithm works by simply appending a range of 0,100 to an empty array and iterating through that array to remove multiples of 2, 3, 5 and 7. For a more advanced explanation on how to the Seive of Eratosthenes works and the different types of sieves you can implement please refer to this resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
